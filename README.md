This package contains nodes for controlling grohe sense devices via the following API:
https://idp2-apigw.cloud.grohe.com


# Dependencies
This package depends on the following libraries
- superagent
- he
- url


# Disclaimer
This package is not developed nor officially supported by the company Grohe.
It is for demonstrating how to communicate to the devices using node-red.

# Grohe Sense Node
The node is able to get the status of a Grohe Sense, Grohe Plus or Grohe Guard node.


## Sense
To get the status simply send any msg.payload to the input.

See the example flow [**sense**](examples/sense.json) in the examples folder.



## Sense Guard
To get the status simply send any msg.payload to the input.
To send a command to open the valve you need to send the following message:
```
msg.payload = {  
    command : {
        valve_open: true,
    }
};
```

See the example flow [**sense guard**](examples/senseguard.json) in the examples folder.



## Getting Historical Data
To read out the internal measurement history you need to specify the start and end data as follows:
```
let end = new Date();
let start = new Date();
start.setDate(end.getDate() - 2); // last 2 days.

msg.payload = {  
    data : {
        from : start,
		to : end,
		groupBy : 'hour' // or 'day', 'week', ...
    }
};
```
Date can be passed in milliseconds format, too: e.g. Date.now

```
let now = Date.now();
let end = now;
let start = now - 24 * 60 * 60000;

msg.payload = {
    data : {
        from : start,
        to : end,
		groupBy : 'hour' // or 'day', 'week', ...
    }
}
```

See the example flow [**sense guard last values**](examples/senseguardvalues.json) in the examples folder.  
See the example flow [**sense guard history**](examples/senseguardhistory.json) in the examples folder.
